        • Utilized Polars, NumPy and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, while leveraging ML libraries like scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment.\n
        • Pre-processed unstructured text data, improving dataset quality and reducing noise through the implementation of multiple tested solutions for cleaning and structuring mixed-quality notes.\n
        • Created a pair-wise comparison model to identify similar sentences but found it computationally expensive; instead, implemented PCA and clustering techniques to group similar sentences efficiently.\n
        • Developed a custom BERTopic model on a 50GB domain-specific dataset to categorize topics, enabling filtering of unnecessary information, and allowing for more insight into the dataset.\n
        • Experimented with fine-tuning pre-trained summarization models from Hugging Face for potential optimization.\n
        • Presented a comprehensive report detailing dataset challenges, various ML filtering solutions, and a strategic plan for integrating the summarization tool with RBC’s data management system.`
